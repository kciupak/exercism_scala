object HelloWorld {
  def hello(): String = "Hello, World!"
}



// Instructions
// The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

// "Hello, World!" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

// The objectives are simple:

// Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
// Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
// Submit your solution and check it at the website.
// If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

// Common pitfalls that you should avoid
// Usually there is no need in Scala to use return. For a discussion see here. Or as a quote from that discussion: Don't use return, it makes Scala cry.
